	abstract = {The individual states of order of cellulose found within Valonia, Cladophora, Halocynthia, cotton and wood cellulose were quantified by non-linear least-squares fitting of the 13C NMR spectra. The results from the spectral fittings indicated that a cellulose form giving signals at δ 104.5 (C-1 region) and δ 88.1–88.5 (C-4 region) was present in all the investigated samples. Partial signal suppression by spin-lattice relaxation supported the findings from the spectral fittings. The spectral behavior of this cellulose form indicates it is a less-ordered or a para-crystalline ‘in core’ structure with a somewhat larger mobility than the crystalline cellulose Iα and Iβ allomorphs.}

  abstract  = {Between and within species differences in the properties of nest paper were studied in three species of social wasp (Vespinae). These are discussed in relation to the function and design of comb and envelope and to the requirements placed on the material by differences in nesting habit. Comb paper was thinner than envelope paper in all three species, and denser than envelope paper in D. sylvestris and D. norwegica. Differences were also found in the fibres from which comb and envelope paper were composed. Comb fibres were significantly shorter than envelope fibres in all three species but of the same width. The difference in observed fibre length could result from either the selection of fibres from different sources or from differences in their processing. These two alternative explanations were examined further in D. sylvestris and D. norwegica. There was some evidence that differences observed in comb and envelope fibres were due to their selection from different pulp sources. No evidence was found that comb fibres were shorter as a result of processing in either D. sylvestris or D. norwegica. Several differences were found between species in the properties of comb and envelope paper. Nest paper of D. sylvestris and D. norwegica was significantly thicker and stronger than that of V. vulgaris. Comb paper of D. sylvestris and D. norwegica was also denser than that of V. vulgaris. Nest paper was thicker in D. norwegica than in D. sylvestris but had the same tensile strength. There were also differences in the fibres from which nest paper was composed. Dolichovespula sylvestris and D. norwegica paper had longer, narrower fibres than that of V. vulgaris.}

	abstract = {The possibility of immobilizing a protein with antigenic properties on a solid support offers significant possibilities in the development of immunosensors and vaccine formulations. For both applications, the orientation of the antigen should ensure ready accessibility of the antibodies to the epitope. However, an experimental assessment of the orientational preferences necessarily proceeds through the preparation/isolation of the antigen, the immobilization on different surfaces and one or more biophysical characterization steps. To predict a priori whether favorable orientations can be achieved or not would allow one to select the most promising experimental routes, partly mitigating the time cost towards the final product. In this manuscript, we apply a simple computational model, based on united-residue modelling, to the prediction of the orientation of the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein on surfaces commonly used in lateral-flow devices. These calculations can account for the experimental observation that direct immobilization on gold gives sufficient exposure of the epitope to obtain a response in immunochemical assays.}}

Cuticular lipids with a very similar composition were found on the surface of the larvae, eggs, and adult males of Polistes annularis as well as on the surface of the nest and nest pedicel of the wasp. Hexadecanoic acid and octadecenoic acid were also found on the surface of the nest pedicel and these acids and/or the hydrocarbons may play a defensive role for the wasps.}

    abstract = {Metapolybia wasps construct their nests on flat surfaces using plant materials, which they process into paper. For processing the pulp wasps need water, which is collected by water foragers, and it is transferred to pulp foragers indirectly via a “common stomach.” The common stomach is formed by generalist wasps that can engage in water exchange and can store water in their crops. Our goal is to provide an alternative model for regulating task partitioning in construction behavior, focusing on worker connectivity instead of using threshold curves to model mechanisms of colony-level regulation. We propose that the existence of an information center and of a network of worker interactions, which establish sets of positive and negative feedbacks, allow collective regulation of colony-wide behaviors. Using a Stock and Flow modeling framework, we illustrate that the common stomach could serve both as a temporal storage for water and also as a source of information about the colony’s current demands related to nest construction tasks. Our model predicts that assessing colony needs via individual interactions with the common stomach leads to a robust regulation of task partitioning in construction behavior. Using perturbation experiments in our simulations, we show that this emergent task allocation is able to dynamically adapt to perturbations of the environment and to changes in colony-level demands or population structure. Our model closely mimics and predicts the behavior of Metapolybia wasps, demonstrating that the regulation mechanism based on worker connectivity through a common stomach is a plausible hypothesis for the organization of collective behavior.},
